# Routing_Dynamic
The following collection of scripts is utilized for analyzing the data featured in the 2023 Neuron paper titled "Routing States Transition During Oscillatory Bursts and Attentional Selection," authored by Kianoush Banaie Boroujeni and Thilo Womelsdorf:

stMUA: This script computes the Spike-triggered Multiunit processing for a set of spike times and locations on a multiunit channel.
Modeling: This script contains the MATLAB code used to generate the spike-LFP model of interacting spiking networks.
Burst Detection: This script is used for identifying narrow-band LFP bursts.
